For this project, I scheduled a tutoring session with my new hero Asiha Braxton-Garvin who saved the day and taught me not to fear syntax (as much). Due to my system constraints (my computer kept crashing while trying to crunch these numbers), I had to split the VBA into multiple subroutines, resulting in a sloppy mess that is not due in any way, shape, or form to the painstaking care that Asiha took with my project, helping me initially refine it into the streamlined work of elegance that it was until I panicked and split it up at the last moment, copying full swafts at a time to insure I didn't accidentally leave anything out. Had I more time, you'd be impressed.
